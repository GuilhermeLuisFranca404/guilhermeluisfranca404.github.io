    <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #8892b0; line-height: 26px; font-family: serif;">
      Hello! My name is Guilherme and I enjoy creating software, especially websites. My interest in web development
      started back in 2019, just thinking about creating games, I started creating some in Java, later I got to know web
      development tinkering html and css, so I decided learn backend with Java that I already used and fell in love,
      rest is history.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 20px; color: #8892b0; line-height: 26px; font-family: serif;">
      I'm a software developer&lt;T&gt;, pragmatic, generic yet expert, provide excellent experiences where I plan,
      designing the software, create and deploy, presenting a great experience with great security, versatility and performance.
      My specialization is more in the back-end, where I specialize in the Spring ecosystem and learn dev-ops culture,
      especially with AWS.</p>
